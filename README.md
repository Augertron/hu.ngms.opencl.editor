This plugin creates an editor for OpenCL kernel source (based on the CDT C editor). In addition to the features of the default C editor, the plugin provides syntax highlighting for OpenCL keywords and checks the kernel code for invalid expressions using pre-defined validation rules. Validation rules are implemented as CODAN checkers.

## Roadmap ##
* Symbols to map OpenCL language elements to C language (define, typedef rules).
* CODAN checkers for invalid expressions.
